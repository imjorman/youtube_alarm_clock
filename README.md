# Youtube Alarm Clock

## Program Objective
Program will take a time as a command line argument and at the user selected time, open a youtube video in a browser.  

## Details
The youtube videos will be stored in a text file.  The program will randomly choose one to open in a browser and play at the selected time.  Computer time is grabbed in the 12 hour format, using AM/PM designations.

## Current Status
Program currently functions as I expect.  I've currently tested to make sure user input errors are caught, random videos open and don't cause crashes, and that the time strings are properly formatted so that they match. I'm not sure what other bugs to test for.  I'm calling this project "done", but I'm also prepared for somoene to tell me I've made an egregious error.
